# UI Directory

This directory contains placeholder files for future UI implementation.

## Structure

- `themes/` - UI theme definitions (colors, fonts, spacing)
- `panels/` - Future UI panels (admin menu, player list, etc.)
- `components/` - Reusable UI components

## Future Implementation

The UI system is designed to be modular and will include:
- Admin menu panel
- Player management interface
- Ban/warn management
- Server configuration interface
- Command history viewer
- Real-time server statistics

All UI components will use the theme system defined in `themes/cl_theme_base.lua` for consistent styling.
